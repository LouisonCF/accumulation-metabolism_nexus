# The accumulation-metabolism nexus: internationalization, labour-capital relations, and material flows of French capitalism since the post-war era -- Replication kit
This repository contains the R code and data to replicate figures in __Cahen-Fourot L., Magalhães N., forthcoming, The accumulation-metabolism nexus: internationalization, labour-capital relations, and material flows of French capitalism since the post-war era__, _Socio-Economic Review_, available [here](LINK TO BE ADDED WHEN ARTICLE IS AVAILABLE ONLINE)

The code formats data in long format and generates the figures in order of appearance in the main article and the technical appendix.

---
Make sure you have the dataset _Cahen-Fourot_Magalhaes_2023_Accumulation-metabolism_nexus_SER_replication_data.xlsx_ that you find in the same folder. This file contains the all the series displayed on the figures. We recommend to use the _Cahen-Fourot_Magalhaes_2023_Accumulation-metabolism_nexus_SER_replication.rproj_ file to ensure that the code runs in the correct working directory.

Make sure your R version and the packages are up-to-date! This code was tested under R 4.3.1.

## Results

The code generates the figures of the main article and of the technical appendix.
In addition, the code generates pdf files for all the figures, exported in the same folder as the code and the datafile.
